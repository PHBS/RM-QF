# Recent trends in MA thesis defense

## Failed Thesis
  * Every year, 5% (15-20) students fail in thesis defense.
  * There is a big variation in thesis defense evaluation. It has been raised as an issue and the faculty have been trying to resolve the problem.
  * However, the thesis that failed are low-quality and the thesis with good quality passes with few exceptions. (low-quality thesis sometimes pass and sometimes fail depending on luck.)
  * Rule of thumb: __`Write a good thesis!`__  

##  Academic contribution is less important. However ...
  * `Academic contribution` has been the main source of score variation because the level of academic contribution (for pass) is hard to define and is subject to faculty member.
  * However, it doesn't mean that a thesis may have zero contribution. 
  * All thesis are still required to have `new elements` to the literature. `New elements` can be broadly defined. 
  * Replication, survey, horse racing papers also contain `new elements`. (Will discuss more on this.)

## Effort of students are more important
  * The thesis should be clearly differentiated from course project reports in terms of completeness, length, and devoted time. 
  * You should have a good understanding of the research question: `why the topic is important?` / `what is the story?` / `why replicate?`
  * Your thesis should be a complete story. 

## Format of thesis is important
* Plagiarism check: School runs plagiarism check before 1-2 weeks of defense. 
  * `> 40%`: Disqualified for defense (no presentation)
  * `> 10%`: Warning. Final thesis should be below 10% or fail.
* Structure of paper, citation, references, English, etc. Samples will be audited by ministry of education. (Will discuss more on this.)
