# On the contribution of thesis

* `Academic contribution` is now considered less important in defense.
* However, your thesis should contain new elements. 

## What can be new elements?
* What can your thesis add to the knowledge of people around you (vs human being)?
* The new elements do not have to be `great`, `ingenious`, `creative`, `new`, etc. 
* You should provide answers to `research questions`
* Asking a right question usually lead to good research.
* But `research questions` can be much broader than you think. (see below)

## Type of new elements

### 1. New empirical finding / theory / model / method / etc
  * New hypothesis, channels, econometric method, etc
  * However, there is nothing new under the sun.
  * Most of `new findings` are incremental or build upon existing findings.
  * There is always context why such new result came out.

### 2. Replication 
  * Tweak on an existing (established/well-known) research
  * Extension of empirical evidence: China market data, etc
  * Application of theory/model paper to empirical data (mix and match)
  * But you need to justify why your topic is meaningful? `Research question` again!
     * Why testing against China data is meaningful? Any element in China data to strengthen/weaken the original paper? 
     * The same approach has been tried before?
     * 

### 3. Horse racing / survey paper
  * Extensive summary of existing methods
  * Systematic comparison of the performance of existing methods / hypothesis
  * When and why such one method is better than the ohters.
  * Often, this of research leads to new ideas/finding.

### Example 1:
* One important question in market microstructure is where does the price discovery occurs when similar products are traded in several markets. (E.g., stock vs futures)
* There are two important methods to measure the price discovery shares:
  * **Information Share**: Hasbrouck, J., 1995. **One Security, Many Markets: Determining the Contributions to Price Discovery.** [The Journal of Finance 50, 1175–1199](https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1540-6261.1995.tb04054).
  * **Component Share**: Gonzalo, J., Granger, C., 1995. **Estimation of Common Long-Memory Components in Cointegrated Systems.** [Journal of Business & Economic Statistics 13, 27–35.](https://doi.org/10.1080/07350015.1995.10524576)
* There is a paper systematically comparing the two is as famous as the two original ones: 
  * Baillie, R.T., Geoffrey Booth, G., Tse, Y., Zabotina, T., 2002. **Price discovery and common factor models.** [Journal of Financial Markets 5, 309–321](https://doi.org/10.1016/S1386-4181(02)00027-7).


### Example 2:
* [SABR volatility model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SABR_volatility_model) is one of the most popular stochastic volatility model to explain volatility smile.
* The original paper provided an approximate formula to quickly compute the Black-Scholes volatility. However, this formula is not very accurate.
* Several improvements have been proposed. Each claim that the method is superior to the original method. However there is no research comparing the new methods.
* So I posted a question on [Quant StachExchange](https://quant.stackexchange.com/questions/42307/comparison-of-various-improvements-to-hagans-sabr-formula). No answer. So I proposed this as a thesis topic.
* Zhang, Z., 2019. `Who is the winner of the analytic approximations for the SABR model?` (mathesis). Peking University HSBC Business School, Shenzhen, China.
* Drawback: lacks

## Suggestion for Choosing Topic
* Topic does not have to be so big. You may set a small goal, but plan to achieve it thoroughly. Then, ideas will follow soon.
  * `Though beginning seems humble, future will be prosperous`
  * `Start from where you are, not from where you want to be`
  * `Stay hungry. Stay foolish.`
* Find topic around you: 
  * Any topic related to courses you took?
  * Any topic you were curious?
  * Any topic you think is not correct?
  * Any topic you want to thoroughly understand (i.e. survey)?
  * Can you improve any course project you did?
* Be creative and critical in choosing topic. Keep asking questions!
